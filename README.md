Project Description:
"Search Your Data" is an innovative generative AI project designed to empower companies with a secure and efficient solution for querying large volumes of confidential information stored within multiple PDF documents. Powered by OpenAI in the backend, this project enables users to train a Language Learning Model (LLM) with their specific dataset, ensuring a tailored and accurate response to queries.

Key Features:
•	Tailored Training Process: Users can upload their personal PDF documents to train the model, ensuring that it is well-versed in the specific content and context of their data.
•	Confidentiality Assurance: Ideal for companies handling sensitive information, "Search Your Data" provides a secure environment for data processing, eliminating the risk of leakage or exposure to the public.
•	Efficient Query Resolution: Once trained, the model becomes adept at swiftly providing precise solutions to user queries, significantly expediting the search process.
•	Advanced Data Handling: The project employs sophisticated techniques to process PDFs, breaking them down into manageable word chunks and storing them in a vector table using FAISS, ensuring optimal efficiency in data retrieval.
•	Intuitive User Interface: "Search Your Data" boasts a user-friendly UI developed with the Streamlit library, allowing for easy navigation and seamless interaction with the platform.

"Search Your Data" is a powerful tool tailored for organizations seeking a secure and efficient means of accessing their confidential data without compromising on privacy. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and robust data handling techniques, this project offers a strategic advantage in managing and extracting value from large volumes of sensitive information.
